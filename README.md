# EasyNode.PRO Validator Toolbox for Findora

## Findora Validator Toolbox
Here's our validator toolbox for the Findora network.

## Requirements
Currently you must run Ubuntu 22.04LTS which comes with a proper version of python to support the tools necessary.

## Install Findora
Currently we'll run the installer if `fn` is not present on your system. Clone the repository and run the app to get started:
```text
cd ~/ && git clone https://github.com/easy-node-pro/validatortoolbox_fra.git && cd validatortoolbox_fra && pip3 install -r requirements.txt && cd ~/ && python3 ~/validatortoolbox_fra/src/app.py
```

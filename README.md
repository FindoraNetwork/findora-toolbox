We are no longer operating on Fractal. We are leaving this here for a CTO if needed. The code for unjailing is [here](https://github.com/FindoraNetwork/findora-toolbox/tree/a5f0a5cd56ff048529892336b1bc009c17ea783f/release-from-jail) in the repository history but there are no instructions provided. EasyNodePro.com will still unjail fractal validators for a small fee, join our [discord](https://easnodepro.com/links) and file a ticket for help.

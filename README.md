# EasyNode.PRO Validator Toolbox for Findora

## Findora Validator Toolbox
Here's the [EasyNode.PRO](https://easynode.pro) validator toolbox for the Findora network.  

## Requirements
Findora suggests the following server requirements:
Minimum: 8GB RAM, 2 Core CPU (2.90GHz per core), 100GB Hard Disk
Recommended: 16GB RAM, 4 Core CPU (2.90Ghz per core), 300GB Hard Disk

## Fresh server installation
Currently we'll run the installer if `fn` is not present on your system. Clone the repository and run the app to get started:
```text
cd ~/ && git clone https://github.com/easy-node-pro/validatortoolbox_fra.git && cd validatortoolbox_fra && pip3 install -r requirements.txt --quiet && cd ~/ && python3 ~/validatortoolbox_fra/src/app.py
```

## Add to an existing Findora server
You certainly can check out the package and run it just like anyone else, you'll want to update apt list first though and install python3-pip at a minimum. This will make sure everything is ready:
```text
cd ~/ && sudo apt install python3-pip -y && git clone https://github.com/easy-node-pro/validatortoolbox_fra.git && cd validatortoolbox_fra && pip3 install -r requirements.txt --quiet && cd ~/ && python3 ~/validatortoolbox_fra/src/app.py
```

## Migrate to a new server
You can use the toolbox to easily migrate to a new server. We suggest starting with a fresh server and letting it sync up on the blockchain.  

Once you're at that point, perform the following:
- On the new server, make a folder named `~/migrate` in your home directory. We suggest `mkdir ~/migrate`
- On the new server, use a transfer app to drop your `tmp.gen.keypair` and `priv_validator_key.json` files into the new `~/migrate` folder.
- At this point you are ready to convert the new server to your uploaded keys.
- On the old server, shut off the old server now to **avoid double signing**.
- On the new server, run validator toolbox and you'll now see option #888 to migrate server. Run this option and you will be converted over to the keys in migrate and brought back online.

## Run the Validator Toolbox Menu after Installation
After installing you can use the following code for a termius/moba snippet and we also suggest using this full command to update and run each time you want to launch the toolbox:
```text
cd ~/validatortoolbox_fra/ && git pull && pip3 install -r requirements.txt --quiet && cd ~/ && python3 ~/validatortoolbox_fra/src/app.py
```
